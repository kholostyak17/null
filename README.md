## description

- This project was bootstraped using Create React App template.

- In order to develop the functionalities of this small project, I have used different dependencies, such as:

  - [x] react
  - [x] react-router
  - [x] sass
  - [x] redux
  - [x] axios
  - [x] jest
  - [x] react testing library
  - [x] cypress

- All the styles and components were created from scratch without using any library
